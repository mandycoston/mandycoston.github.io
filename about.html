        <p>
       Amanda Coston is a PhD student in Machine Learning and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). Her research considers fairness in algorithmic decision support systems, and she is particularly interested in how methods from causal inference can improve these systems. She is advised by <a href= "https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/achoulde/">Alexandra Chouldechova</a> and <a href="http://www.ehkennedy.com/">Edward H. Kennedy</a>. 
     </p>
     <h2>Involvement</h2>
     Amanda is a co-organizer of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/prod/view/ml4d">ML4D workshop </a> at NeurIPS, which brings machine learning researchers together with field practitioners to discuss ML in the context of the developing world. This year the workshop will explore the risks and challenges of using ML4D. <a href="https://sites.google.com/prod/view/ml4d-nips-2018">Last year's workshop </a> focused on creating sustainable ML solutions for development challenges.
     <br>
     <br>

     Amanda co-organizes the Fairness, Ethics, Accountability, and Transparency (FEAT) reading group at CMU. She also served on the program committee of FAT* 2020, AAAI-2020 Emerging Track on AI for Social Impact, and AI for Social Good at IJAI 2019.

     <br>


     She particularly enjoys teaching and mentorship opportunties. She served as a project lead of the <a href="http://ai-4-all.org/">AI4ALL</a> summer program at CMU, where she introduced high school students to algorithmic fairness in the criminal justice system using the COMPAS dataset (see Github <a href= "https://github.com/mandycoston/compas-analysis">project</a>). She also participates in the AI undergradate mentoring program at CMU.

     <h2>Notable</h2>
     Amanda is an NSF GRFP fellow.

     Her research on counterfactual risk assessments and evalution for child welfare screening won the 2018 Suresh Konda Best First Student Research Paper Award from the Heinz College.



         <h2>Background</h2>
         Amanda graduated from Princeton in 2013 with a degree in computer science and a certificate in the Woodrow Wilson School of Public Policy and International Affairs. For her undergraduate thesis, she analyzed how machine learning techniques can improve the diagnosis of pediatric tuberculosis in collaboration with Jocelyn Tang ('14) and under the guidance of Robert Schapire. In 2019 she earned her Master of Science in Machine Learning from CMU.
