        <p>Amanda Coston is a PhD student in <a href="https://www.ml.cmu.edu/current-students/joint-phd-in-machine-learning-and-public-policy-requirements.html">Machine Learning and Public Policy</a> at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). Her research considers fairness in algorithmic decision support systems. She is advised by <a href= "https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/achoulde/">Alexandra Chouldechova</a> and <a href="http://www.ehkennedy.com/">Edward H. Kennedy</a>. 
<br> 
      <h2>Research projects</h2>
      Her research considers the impact of algorithmic risk assessments in settings such as child welfare screening, criminal justice, and loan approvals. She is particularly interested in how techniques from causal inference and transfer learning can resolve current limitations of these systems. Her research focuses on questions of fairness.
