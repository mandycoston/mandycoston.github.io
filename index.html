        <h2>Amanda Coston</h2>
       Amanda Coston is a PhD student in Machine Learning and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University.

       <h2>Research</h2> 
       Amanda's research areas are algorithmic decision support systems, causal inference, algorithmic fairness, and machine learning for healthcare. Her advisor is Roni Rosenfeld, and she works with Alexandra Chouldechova, George Chen, and Edward Kennedy.

       <h3>Opioid Epidemic</h3>
       In 2017, drug overdoses claimed more lives than car accidents. The below maps show opioid hotspots across the United States at various granularities. We used a similarity metric of death rate trajectories derived from Fisher's exact test to perform hierarchical clustering. <br>

         <h2>Machine Learning for the Developing World</h2>
         Amanda co-organized the <a href="https://sites.google.com/prod/view/ml4d-nips-2018">ML4D workshop </a> at NeurIPS, which brought machine learning researchers together with field practitioners to discuss sustainable ML solutions for development challenges.

         <h2>Background</h2>
         Amanda graduated from Princeton in 2013 with a degree in computer science and a certificate in the Woodrow Wilson School of Public Policy and International Affairs. For her undergraduate thesis, she analyzed how machine learning techniques can improve the diagnosis of pediatric tuberculosis in collaboration with Jocelyn Tang ('14) and under the guidance of Robert Schapire.
